# About me

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
    </div>
    <p> Hi there! I'm a third-year graduate student in the math department at Boston College, working with [Martin Bridgeman](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/martin-bridgeman/). Before that, I obtained a Master's degree in Mathematics at UdelaR (in Uruguay, my home country), advised by [Rafael Potrie](https://sites.google.com/view/rafaelpotrie/home).

    <div style="margin-left: 20px; text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/Index.HEIC" alt="My Picture" style="width: 250px; border-radius: 10px;">
        <p style="font-size: 14px; color: gray;"> Credits for this picture goes to Joe Boninger. The sutured manifolds are also his, but the bad handwritting in between is all mine.</p>
    </div>
    <p> I spend most of my time thinking about discrete subgroups of Lie groups and their interaction with geometric structures. Sometimes, I also venture into low-dimensional topology, but sadly, time is finite.
