Hi there! I'm a third-year graduate student in the math department at Boston College, working with [Martin Bridgeman](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/martin-bridgeman/). Before that, I obtained a Master's degree in Mathematics at UdelaR (in Uruguay, my home country), advised by [Rafael Potrie](https://sites.google.com/view/rafaelpotrie/home). 

I work in Geometry and Topology. Most specifically, I think about discrete subgroups of Lie groups.

Feel free to contact me by email at: lemajo (at) bc (dot) edu.
