# About me

Hi there! I'm a third-year graduate student in the math department at Boston College, working with [Martin Bridgeman](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/martin-bridgeman/). Before that, I obtained a Master's degree in Mathematics at UdelaR (in Uruguay, my home country), advised by [Rafael Potrie](https://sites.google.com/view/rafaelpotrie/home).

        <p style="font-size: 14px; color: gray;">This is me, deep in thought!</p>

I spend most of my time thinking about discrete subgroups of Lie groups and their interaction with geometric structures. Sometimes, I also venture into low-dimensional topology, but sadly, time is finite.
