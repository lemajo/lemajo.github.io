# About me

Hi there! I'm a third-year graduate student in the math department at Boston College, working with Martin Bridgeman. Before that, I obtained a Master's degree in Mathematics at UdelaR (in Uruguay, my home country), advised by Rafael Potrie.
I spend most of my time thinking about discrete subgroups of Lie groups and their interaction with geometric structures. Sometimes, I also venture into low-dimensional topology, but sadly, time is finite.
Here you can find a copy of my CV (hopefully up to date).
