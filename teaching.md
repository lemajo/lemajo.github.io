### Mentorship & Outreach

I strongly believe in building community through mathematics.

* **Directed Reading Program (DRP):**
    * *Mentor for undergraduate students on [Topic, e.g., Hyperbolic Geometry].* (If you did this, add it! If not, delete).

* **Outreach:**
    * **Talleres de Matemática** (Uruguay): I designed and delivered workshops on Euclidean Geometry for high school teachers and students.
