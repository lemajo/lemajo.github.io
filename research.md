## Brief description of my research:
My goal for last year was to find nice families of representations for which you could hope to get quantitative information of their infinitesimal variation (this was motivated by the Pressure metric).
I cannot say I was succesful, but I ended up learning some stuff about representations of triangle groups into $SL_n (\mathbb{R})$, and about representations arising from $G-$opers. We are currently trying to write that down. Lateley, I'm thinking about how to produce deformations of lattices in $PU(1,2)$ into $PGL_n (\mathbb{C})$, but that's still in diapers.
