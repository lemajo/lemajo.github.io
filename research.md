## Brief description of my research:
Last year, I aimed to find nice families of representations for which you could hope to get quantitative information on their infinitesimal variations (this was motivated by the [Pressure metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7459)).
I cannot say I was successful, but I learned some things about representations of triangle groups into $$SL_n (\mathbb{F})$$ and about *G*-opers. We are currently trying to write that down. Lately, I've been thinking about how to produce deformations of lattices in $$PU(1,2)$$ into $$PGL_n (\mathbb{C})$$, but sadly, time is finite.

## In preparation

- **Bisectors in $$SL_n (\mathbb{F})$$ and representations of Coxeter groups**  
   *Joint with [Joaquin Lejtreger](https://joacolej.github.io)*
- **An Epstein construction for G-opers**
